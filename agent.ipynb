      "Okay, I need to help restructure this resume to align with the job description for the Machine Learning Engineer position at LATAM. Let me start by understanding the job requirements and the candidate's current resume.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the job asks for at least 3 years of experience. The candidate has a role from July 2023 to present (about 1 year) and a previous role from March 2020 to June 2023 (3.5 years), so that's covered. Good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the technologies: SQL, Python, GCP, Terraform, CI/CD are mandatory. The candidate has Python, SQL, GCP (mentioned in Azure and GCP in skills), but Terraform isn't listed. Wait, in the current resume under Brain Food, they mention deploying on GCP using Langchain, Langraph, but maybe they can highlight Terraform somewhere. The job also mentions Vertex AI as a plus, which the candidate has a certification in Datacamp's Machine Learning Engineer course, which might include Vertex AI? The candidate's education includes a specialization in NLP from DeepLearning.ai.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resume's current structure has sections like Work Experience, Education, Research Experience, Technical Skills, Certifications. The job description emphasizes contributions to ML models in production, MLOps, and collaboration with DevOps/SRE. The candidate's experience includes deploying models in production, using MLOps practices like CI/CD (mentioned in the Brain Food role with GitHub Actions, Airflow?), and working with cloud platforms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Ensure the resume highlights the required technical skills and keywords from the job. The candidate mentions GCP but maybe not explicitly Terraform. They should include Terraform under cloud services or infra. Also, mention Vertex AI more prominently since it's a plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: The work experience should lead with the most relevant role first, which it does (Brain Food). But maybe rephrase bullet points to emphasize the key requirements. For example, in Brain Food, the candidate mentions deploying agents in Azure and GCP, but Vertex AI isn't mentioned. The certification on Datacamp includes Vertex AI, so that should be highlighted. \n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Quantify achievements where possible. The current resume has some percentages (like 15% increase in customer acquisition), but maybe more can be added. The job mentions \"efficiency\" and \"scalability,\" so quantifying those aspects would help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: The resume's structure might be a bit cluttered. The technical skills are in a table with subheadings. Maybe reorganize them to group cloud services, MLOps tools (like DVC, MLflow), and explicitly list Terraform. The certifications could be integrated under a separate section, but maybe mention Vertex AI here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 5: Ensure the summary or objective at the top (if exists) reflects the job's goals, but the current resume doesn't have an objective. Maybe add a brief summary or a Professional Summary section highlighting top qualifications. Since the user didn't include one, perhaps suggest adding a concise summary at the top emphasizing key skills and experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user's resume doesn't have a summary. The job description starts with \"Diseñar, desarrollar y optimizar soluciones basadas en LLMs y ML...\" so the candidate's experience with GenAI agents and LLMs in Brain Food is relevant. Maybe leading with that in a summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, check the education part. The candidate has a Master's in Computational Engineering and a Minor in Data Science, which are relevant. Maybe order the education in reverse chronological order, which it is, so that's okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The languages are listed, but the job requires intermediate/advanced English, which the candidate has B2. Should that be more visible?\n",
      "\n",
      "Possible steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prioritize Key Technical Skills and Keywords**: Add Terraform and Vertex AI explicitly in the technical skills section. Under cloud services, list GCP with Vertex AI, Azure (mentioned), AWS. Also, ensure terms like MLOps, CI/CD, DevOps/SRE are highlighted in job descriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Quantify Achievements More Effectively**: For each role, include measurable outcomes. For example, in Brain Food, maybe the 15% improvement in customer acquisition from the previous job? Also, the prediction error reduction to under 10% for Nestlé is good, but maybe more metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reorganize Technical Skills into Cloud, MLOps, and DevOps**: Group cloud services, MLOps tools, and DevOps practices (like Terraform, CI/CD) to mirror the job's requirements. Explicitly mention Vertex AI under certifications or skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Add a Professional Summary Section**: A brief paragraph at the top summarizing the candidate's years of experience, key technologies (GCP, Vertex AI, MLOps), and a highlight of relevant achievements. This makes the resume more scannable.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Ensure Language Skills are Highlighted**: Move the English proficiency to a more prominent place, maybe in the summary or a separate languages section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user's original resume has a separate section for languages. Maybe in the summary, mention the B2 level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the job requires intermediate/advanced English, so the candidate's B2 (which is equivalent to intermediate) is okay, but needs to be clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thought: The candidate has experience with Vertex AI? The certification from Datacamp's Machine Learning Engineer course might mention Vertex AI. The candidate should list Vertex AI under the certifications or technical skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Brain Food experience, the candidate mentions deploying on GCP, so maybe explicitly state Vertex AI there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the job mentions \"desarrollo y optimización de soluciones basadas en LLMs y ML\". The candidate's work with GenAI agents and LLMs in Azure and GCP (maybe Vertex AI?) is relevant, so those points need to be emphasized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the candidate's research in reinforcement learning and NLP could be mentioned in a separate section if needed, but maybe integrate it into the work experience or a projects section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the resume has \"Experiencia de Investigación\" where they worked on reinforcement learning and symbolic regression. Maybe some of those technical terms can be linked to the job's requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting this together, the steps would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Add a professional summary at the top highlighting key qualifications, including 4+ years of experience (since their senior data engineer role was 3.5 years, plus Brain Food's current role, totaling over 4?), technical stack (GCP, Vertex AI, Terraform, MLOps), and achievements like error reduction or customer acquisition increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Reorganize skills section to group Cloud (explicitly listing Vertex AI under GCP), MLOps (MLflow, DVC, CI/CD tools), and mention Terraform. Ensure keywords like Vertex AI are included.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Quantify achievements with metrics and percentages where possible. Maybe in Brain Food, the 11% sales increase for the Salvador company should be highlighted more prominently. The 15% improvement in customer acquisition from their previous job is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Ensure all mandatory tech (SQL, Python, GCP, Terraform, CI/CD) are clearly listed. The candidate has Terraform listed? Wait, in the Brain Food experience, they mention \"infraestructure in the cloud using containers on GCP\" but Terraform isn't mentioned. The candidate's skills list includes Docker, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, which are CI/CD. Maybe they used Terraform in their work? The resume doesn't mention it. Hmm, that's a problem. The job requires Terraform. The resume doesn't show Terraform. That's a gap. Wait, the user's original resume under Brain Food's work entry: \"Implementé infraestructura en la nube con despliegues en contenedores para agentes de GenAI en GCP usando Langchain, Langraph, etc. But no Terraform.\" So the candidate might not have Terraform experience, which is a requirement. But since the user can't add fake info, maybe they can include it if they have it. Wait, in their technical skills, under Servicios en la Nube, they list GCP with Vertex AI, etc., but not Terraform. The resume's skills list under \"Servicios en la Nube\" include GCP with Vertex AI, Databricks, etc. Terraform is under \"Frameworks\"? No, in the technical skills table, the left column has Software (Docker, Git, etc.), and the right column has cloud services. Terraform is a cloud configuration tool, so maybe it's missing. The candidate might not have it, but the job requires it. Since the user can't add it if not present, but the user can't make up skills. However, the user might have used Terraform indirectly, but it's better to leave it as is. Wait, the job says \"es indispensable\" so Terraform is mandatory. The candidate's resume doesn't list it. Hmm, but the user's resume might need to include it if they have it. Since the user is asking to optimize for keywords, maybe mention Terraform if applicable. But in the provided resume, it's not there. Maybe the candidate used Terraform? If not, the resume might be weak there, but the user can't add it. So perhaps the steps can't include adding Terraform unless the candidate has it. The user's resume might lack that, but the steps have to be feasible. So maybe suggest adding Terraform if present, but since it's not in the resume, perhaps the user can't. But the user's steps can't add new info. Therefore, the step should focus on what's present. Maybe under the Brain Food role, if they used Terraform in GCP, maybe rephrase to include it. Alternatively, perhaps they used other tools but need to align with the required keywords. Hmm, tricky. The user can't invent, but can rephrase existing info. For example, if they used Docker and CI/CD pipelines, maybe phrase it as \"Implemented CI/CD pipelines with Terraform for infrastructure as code on GCP\" if that's accurate, but only if they did. Since the original resume doesn't mention Terraform, maybe the step is to ensure all required keywords are present, so even if missing Terraform, maybe suggest adding it if they used it, but the user might not have. Since the user's original resume doesn't have it, the steps can't add it. So the steps have to work with existing content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the candidate used Terraform but it's not listed. Let's assume the user can't add Terraform, so steps focus on existing keywords. Maybe under the Brain Food experience, they can mention \"Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform on GCP\" if applicable. But since it's not there, perhaps the step is to ensure that all required tech stack keywords are emphasized, even if some are missing. The job requires Terraform, so maybe the candidate does have it but it's not listed. The user might need to add it. But since the resume doesn't include it, the step might need to suggest adding Terraform if present. Since the user's input doesn't have it, perhaps the step is to ensure the skills are formatted clearly, maybe reorganize the technical skills section to prioritize GCP with Vertex AI, and ensure Terraform is listed if possible. But the user can't add it if not present. Hmm, the user might have made a mistake in not including Terraform. Maybe the step is to check for that, but since the user can only work with existing data, the step must use existing info.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proceeding:\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1: Create a Professional Summary (Objective) at the top to quickly align with the job's requirements, emphasizing 4+ years of experience in ML solutions, GCP, Vertex AI, and MLOps, highlighting the candidate's role in deploying models with a focus on scalability and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Highlight Vertex AI and Terraform where relevant. Even if Terraform isn't listed, perhaps in the Brain Food role's bullet points, mention Terraform if used. Wait, in the Brain Food experience, they mention using Langchain, Langraph, and GCP. Maybe the infrastructure part can mention Terraform if applicable. Alternatively, maybe the candidate used another tool, but the job requires Terraform, so it's a gap. Since the resume doesn't have Terraform, perhaps the steps can't fix that, so better focus on what's there but not emphasized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Reorganize the technical skills into subsections like Cloud Platforms (explicitly stating GCP with Vertex AI, Azure, AWS), MLOps (MLflow, DVC, CI/CD), DevOps Practices (Docker, Kubernetes maybe?), but looking at existing skills. The candidate has Docker, CI/CD tools, so maybe list Terraform under cloud infrastructure if present. Since not listed, perhaps suggest including if applicable, but the user's data doesn't have it. Hmm, maybe the candidate has Terraform experience but it's under frameworks? The technical skills list includes frameworks like MLflow, Scikit-learn, etc., but Terraform is an IaC tool. Maybe in the Software section, add Terraform if used. If not, they might be at a disadvantage, but the steps can't invent it. So perhaps the best is to ensure existing keywords are highlighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Use the certification in Datacamp's Machine Learning Engineer to showcase MLOps and Vertex AI understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 5: Ensure that the achievements in production deployments of LLMs and MLOps are clearly stated with metrics. For example, in Brain Food, the 11% sales increase and <10% error.\n",
