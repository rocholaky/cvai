**Data Scientist** July 2023 – Present
*Brain Food, an Artefact company*

  - Developed and implemented **forecasting models** to optimize demand prediction in a *Sell-in/Sell-out* context for the food industry, **achieving an**
**error margin below 10% (Nestl´e)** . Designed retail sales prediction models that **improved accuracy by 11%** over previous approaches by
evaluating methods such as Prophet, tree-based models, and ARIMA.

  - Processed, analyzed, and trained models on **large-scale datasets (** ***>*** **60 million records)** in **big data environments**, utilizing **PySpark and**
**SQL** for model and algorithm optimization. Implemented **automated machine learning pipelines** in PySpark ML to improve scalability and
efficiency in model building.

  - Led the development and coding of **user classification and segmentation models** using machine learning techniques for **churn prediction,**
**user clustering, and purchase propensity modeling** . The code was integrated into production-ready environments by the operations team, in
accordance with Visa’s strict security policies.

  - Collaborated with **product and engineering teams** to integrate predictive models into production systems, ensuring proper implementation and
providing key insights for strategic decision-making.

  - Developed and productized **GenAI agents** utilizing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for the automated evaluation of instructors.
Designed support agents for experimental design using frameworks such as **Langchain and Langraph**, applied in companies like Femsa.

  - Contributed to the winning team in a **competitive bidding process** for Nestl´e by delivering robust and accurate forecasting models, **outperforming**
**14 competing firms** .

**Senior Data Engineer** March 2020 – June 2023
*Arkenco Marketing and Sales Analytics*

  - Led the modernization of Arkenco’s data infrastructure through the development of **scalable and automated pipelines**, integrating multiple data
sources and enhancing real-time information availability for marketing and sales strategy optimization.

  - Developed **Arkenco CRM**, a robust solution based on **Docker, Python (Django), and React**, strengthening backend infrastructure to support a
growing client base and improve operational efficiency.

  - Innovated client interactions by integrating the platform with the **WhatsApp API** and developing **intelligent chatbots**, automating client
communications and contributing to a **15% increase in client acquisition** .

**Machine Learning Engineer Intern** January – March 2020
*Asicom*

  - Designed a prototype chatbot capable of extracting information from national ID card images, as well as from PDF and Excel documents through
automated document processing.

  - Developed an internal tutorial on the use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for training company staff on cloud technologies.
